		<p>As is indicated above, my favorite Flash of all time is the 90's Wally West. 
		Wally began as the kid sidekick of Barry Allen, the Flash of the Silver Age. 
		But then a great even happened called the Crisis on Infinite Earths, and Barry 
		was trapped in the future, causing Wally to take over.</p> 
		
		<p>What I really liked about Wally as a character was how approachable he was as
		a hero. He protected a place called "Keystone City" and in that city his "secret"
		identity was common knowledge. He said hi to people on their way to work and dropped
		in on people to give them surprise pizza party. When Wally was the Flash, he always had time
		to stop and say hey.</p>
